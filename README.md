🌫️ Bangalore AQI Prediction using AI/ML
This repository contains a complete Python project for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interactive visualization. A user-friendly Streamlit web application allows users to input values and receive real-time AQI predictions with graphical outputs. This project aims to support environmental awareness and data-driven decision-making for pollution control.

📦 What's Included?

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb):
A step-by-step notebook covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.

Trained Machine Learning Model (.pkl):
A saved model file that can be used for deployment and instant inference.

Streamlit Frontend (app.py):
A clean and responsive web app where users can enter environmental data and receive AQI predictions along with visual indicators.

Dataset (.csv):
The original dataset used for training and testing the model, including parameters like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, temperature, and humidity.

Screenshots Folder:
Contains sample images of the Streamlit app interface and prediction outputs.

🎯 Objective

To use machine learning for predicting AQI levels in Bangalore.
To provide an interactive platform for real-time AQI forecasting.
To raise awareness of air pollution and its trends using AI.
